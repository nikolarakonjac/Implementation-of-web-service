Goal of this project is to implement web service using Python programming language, Flask framework, SQLAlchemy library and Docker. 
The system consists of two parts: one for users and one for store management, with different databases and mutual restriction of access.
Both parts of the system consist of several components implemented using containers created based on the Docker Image template, with addition of data preserving in the databases if container stop working.
